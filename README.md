# Jokes App

This is a simple web application that fetches jokes from the [JokeAPI](https://sv443.net/jokeapi/v2/) and displays them to the user. The application was created as an exercise as part of my Udemy course on web development.

## Features

- Fetches random jokes from the JokeAPI.
- Displays jokes in a user-friendly interface.
- Allows the user to request a new joke with a button click.

## Technologies Used

- **Express.js**: For setting up the server and handling routes.
- **EJS**: For rendering dynamic HTML templates.
- **Axios**: For making HTTP requests to the JokeAPI.
- **HTML & CSS**: For structuring and styling the user interface.
- **JavaScript**: For managing client-side interactions.



## Purpose

This project was created as a part of a web development course on Udemy. The main goal was to practice using APIs and to build a simple, interactive web application. This project is not intended for commercial use, and the code is shared for educational purposes only.
